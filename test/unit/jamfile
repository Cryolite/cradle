# The paths to source files are passed to GCC as absolute ones because Gcovr

# `bjam` will introduce dependency on a path (say, `XXXXX`) into source
# files that have header inclusions `#include <XXXXX>` or `#include "XXXXX"`
# even if `XXXXX` is a relative path to a directory. However, this makes
# trouble. Consider that just one file
# `cradle/test/unit/exception/foo_run.cpp` is modified. This change also
# alters the modification time of directory `cradle/test/unit/exception`.
# Therefore, when `bjam` is invoked with the current directory being
# `cradle/test/unit`, not only the changed file
# `cradle/test/unit/exception/foo_run.cpp` and its dependants but also
# source files that have header inclusions `#include <exception>` or
# `#include "exception"` and its dependants are about to be updated. As a
# result, changes to just one file will propagate to a vast number of
# completely unrelated files.
#
# In order to avoid the above-mentioned problem, an explicit target with an
# obfuscated name inhibits users from invoking `bjam` with the current
# directory being this directory.
